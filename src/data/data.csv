I enjoyed feeling responsible for the house. We had a similar structure of regularly doing chores and cooking meals for each other. I'm looking for a similar sense of community and shared sense of ownership/intentionality for the space.

I enjoy doing activities like board games, card games, puzzles, watching Avatar the Last Airbender, and cooking weird things",2-3,"I woke up holding the brass dingbat, lying on a soft lush carpet in an unfamiliar room. The only door in the room was open, and outside was a forest that I didn't recognize. Last night I was in Brooklyn, and now... where was I? I furrowed my brow as I squinted at the dingbat. Before she had gone, my aunt had given me the dingbat in my hands and said, ""This is a key. Take care of it."" Those had been the last words she ever spoke to me -- words I struggled to parse for a long time after. Well, I hadn't struggled *that* hard. Aunt Claire had been kind of nutty. I had loved that about her. The curiosity around the dingbat had nibbled away in a corner of my mind ever since then, exacerbated by the fact that she would never be able to explain what she had meant. She disappeared without a trace ten years ago, shocking the family and leaving me with nothing but a weird metal dingbat and a rusty old armoire. The armoire in this room looked a lot sleeker than mine. As I looked at it, I was startled to realize that it was rattling a bit. The movement had not come from the black dog, which continued to sleep peacefully on top. It had come from within. As I stared at it again, the doors of the armoire rattled again as if there was some pressure pushing on it from the outside. My heart sank in fear as I pondered what to do. I was in a strange room in a strange place, watching a strange armoire containing who-knows-what, holding Aunt Claire's dingbat. I turned it over in my hands, feeling like there was something that I had to remember...something important. The realization came to me like a lightbulb turning on: last night I had opened my armoire with this dingbat. I had been playing with it, reminiscing about my aunt, and then I had realized that it perfectly fit a hole in the engraving on the side. The doors had swung open, and I couldn't see my clothes. Instead, there was an impenetrable darkness inside. I reached a hand in, then my arm, and then I fell in by accident. It was all black after that, until I woke up on this carpet. My head swirled from the implication -- what was going on? How could my armoire lead to a forest, miles away from Brooklyn? Maybe I was in a dream -- I pinched myself to see. ""Ow!"" Nope. I looked at the dingbat in awe, my aunt's voice whispering in my head, ""this is a key"". I got up and went to the armoire. It was still slightly shaking, but more from a sensation of wind than from anything living inside. I felt around the sides, and I felt the same indentation that I had felt on the old armoire in my room. The dingbat clicked into place as I knew it would, and then the sleek doors popped open on well-oiled hinges. There was nothing inside that I would have expected to be in an armoire. There was only an impenetrable darkness. I pocketed the dingbat and I reached my hand in.","I am an avid cook, I like talking to people and meeting new people!

Rob told us one month ago he would have a room for me. I also know Lucie Petetin, who lived here last year",I am going to do a 10 months research project in the field of biomaterials for stem cells at Stanford University. It would be a dream coming true to fully experience the way of living of a (student-) community in California.,"Single if possible, double and triple are fine too",no :),"- At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, I am part of a community ""Engineers of the World"", where I've meet the most outstanding friends and had lived my best student experiences in my life. 
- In addition to other shared flat experiences, I am the eldest sister of 6 children: I am used to share space with respect, pay attention to others, and de-escalate conflicts ","The most important place in the community would be the kitchen / eating room, where everyone can meet, discuss and chill together (ideally with some sofas). Defining the kitchen as common room would allow everyone to do something useful for the community while having social interactions. My dream community would have some common space to do artistic or social activities (rooms with music instruments, games, ping pong tables, common bookshelf, meditation or yoga room,... ). And everyone should have space to be quite and alone, to take rest when needed. 

Beside the spatial arrangement, the community would offer a time during the week to express feelings or needs, where everyone would be heard. This could be done during an informal house meeting. 

Last but not least, my ideal community would be highly spontaneous, with random parties or jam sessions !!",Around 4 house dinners and I'll try to attend all house meeting,"I wake up suddenly, without any memory of what happened last evening. Looking around, I see a black dog and an open door. Even if I don't feel confortable with dogs, this one gives a sensation of tranquility. His presence reminds me to my grand father, who used to sit on his rocking chair in the living room. 

This thought makes everything clear in my mind! Someone once told me this situation would happen. Aunt Anna was mum's twin sister and best friend. When mum suddenly died two years ago, aunt Anna told me she has a dream with a dog, a forest and a bookshelf, exactly like in this room.  
Now I know what's going to happen. At some point, the dog will wake up and lead me through the forest, behind the door. The time spent in the forest may be long, or short, depending on my readiness. Even without having ever been there, I know that behind the forest are the people I love. I know there is my mum.  
How can I be sure about that? The brass dingbat, which is an ancient symbol needed to pay for the journey through the forest. 
I am thinking that the journey will be hard, not everyone reach the other side. While looking around, I see the bookshelf. It may help me: tt seems to be full with ancient books, all about different aspects of life. The entire world seems to be described in those books! I am strongly attracted by a very old red and green book, with a single word on the front page ""LOVE"". I have the intuition I'll find all answers to my questions in this book, the ones I have asked myself so many times... I feel the excitation growing, as if every cell in my body had become alive and want to reach this book. My finger are going to touch the book…! 

Suddenly,  I am sitting in my bed, feeling still warm and excited, with a feeling of frustration growing. The same dream, again. This time I was so close to get the answers to life's most important question!
 
","I would like to share my passion for balfolk dances (european couple dances) and for celtic music (including harp playing). 
I would greatly enjoy organising or being part of daily or week-end trips. 

As a community member, I would like to bring y enthusiasm to meet people, having discussions (about society, relationships,...) my curiosity and open mindness and help whenever I can. Also I'll bring a flexible and chill mood.

For my master thesis, I was accepted in two different labs, both working on biomaterials, one at Harvard School of Engineering the other one at Stanford School of Medicine.

I’ve made it to the final test! If I make it through this final task, I’ll finally receive my powers and become a full wizard. The first question: what is the task? Let’s explore. The first thing I do is pick up the brass dingbat, it appears to be a trinket, a family heirloom left over generations. I put it in my pocket and approach the dog. Cautiously, I pet its head and it wakes up from its gentle slumber. The dog is friendly and proceeds to walk out into the forest, looking back at me as if gesturing me to follow. I follow the dog out into the forest and find that it is no typical forest. Each tree is different! An oak tree, a fir, a maple tree, pine tree, cherry tree, an olive tree… the list goes on! I look back to my dingbat, and it has printed on it a hazelnut. I’ve never seen a hazelnut tree before, but I start to search. Luckily, I love Nutella so I’m able to find the tree quickly! Strangely it’s guarded by a chipmunk wearing a small cowboy hat. I try to converse with the chipmunk but of course, it doesn’t speak English (silly me!). I hand it the brass trinket, it grabs it and runs up into the tree. Perplexed, I look down at the dog. It seems uninterested in what’s going on and has gone back to sleep. Just as I’m starting to stress about what to do, the chipmunk returns with a golden hazelnut. I say thank you and take it back to the room where I first woke up. There is a second door in the room. Instead of a keyhole, there is a coin-like slot where I drop the hazelnut. A melody plays through the room, a long-forgotten medieval tune. The door opens on its own, I enter and I’m above Palo Alto! Looks like these wizarding powers gave me the ability to fly. Awesome!  ","I’m a musician! I hope to bring music to Ithaka including in-house jam sessions (relatively quiet, before 10pm :)) and inviting residents and our friends to perform in a casual setting. Second, I want to manage the music room. It could be an incredible space to make music with friends if we clean it up and organize it a bit. I want to clean trash & spider webs, add lights and sound insulation, and organize the instruments in the room including noting which ones are use-able. I have my own mics & instruments & recording equipment I'd like to keep there. Furthermore, I’m a fun and friendly person, I bring community and friendship! I’m somewhat technical and like fixing things around the house, and my family’s from Bulgaria and I’ll be sharing some Bulgarian foods and traditions on occasion.","I want community, lifelong friends, and to meet lots of new people!

",3-5,"Luckily I don't have to imagine- funnily enough, this actually happened to me not long ago. Here's what I did- first I started looking through the books on the bookshelf to find the spell book that my Aunt told me would be there. I leafed through it, looking for a very specific spell- an ancient, and highly coveted spell... a spell so valuable and powerful that ancient peoples fought many a war in order to obtain the only book that teaches it. The spell gives the ability to recruit a powerful and loyal ally that brings joy into the lives of all witnesses. For eons, this greatest of spells was thought to be lost in the sands of time, but as my Aunt predicted, here it was, right in front of me. I cautiously started to read the spell and my lips began to tremble as the mighty syllables took on a life of their own- forcing their way out of me and adopting a faintly visible, fluid-like form, before drifting over to the armoire above the sleeping dog. There they hovered thickly, weaving in and out of one another. As I uttered the last syllable of the spell, it joined its predecessors above the armoire and there was a great whirring and crackling sound as the syllables collided with one another in a great mess of iridescent chaos. There was a blinding white light and I heard a sharp yelp... as my eyes adjusted and vision returned, I saw the dog running around in circles as hundreds of dog treats rained down from above. With this mighty spell, I had enough dog treats to become best friends with the large, black dog, named Gertrude. Gertrude taught me about the ways of the forest and all its creatures. When she felt I was ready, Gertrude brought me to a neighboring house in the woods where we encountered a group of strange and wonderful beings. They invited us in and offered us food, and said that we could stay as long as we needed to. Gertrude and I gratefully accepted, and joined them in the backyard for dinner. One of the beings handed us plates and said, ""Welcome to Ithaka!""

I am in no way shape or form a pro fisher, but actually apologize to worms for stabbing them, if I can even get myself to stab them. Well anyways, I was knee deep in the river and then looked to my left. I am a sucker for pretty places, and I saw that the sun was shining through the canopy of trees down the river. Although it was the other farmer's land, I decided to wade through the river and then cross the barbed wire. What I then found was that the sun was shining on the most perfect patch of garlic I had ever seen, I reached out to climb up the embankment to get the garlic, but as soon as I tore up some garlic stems to eat, I was overcome with how perfect the said garlic was, that I must have fallen backwards into the little ditch that led into the river. Brenda, actually being the real mom dog she is [but also annoyed that I wasn't in a state to actually congratulate her on her newest stick found] probably decided to run up to the farmer's house and bring him to me. I don't really know the farmer because my mom warned me about talking with him [something about a feud between them, I don't quite know why], but I am figuring that I must be in his place.

Given the other qualities of my situation, it's not too bad of a bet to make. (Also, in real life, I am currently in a Mythology class and last week we heard a telling of the Firebird Russian folktale. In it, the horse frequently gives the hunter kind, sound, thoughtful advice - perhaps I could luck out with such advice from the black dog.) Next I would be very tempted to venture into the forest, because I love forests and they make me feel most myself and whole. But I would feel some apprehension about the safety of this unknown forest, so I would first check if the dog could give me advice. If the dog couldn't give me advice, I might check around the room briefly for clues. Then, if I still had no direction, I'd probably collect whatever provisions in the room seemed mildly useful and venture into the forest in search of society/family/friends/a way to survive.

Ithaka appeals to me because of the community that comes along with co-ops. I am excited by the opportunity to share meals, space, and friendship with each Ithakan. I want to be able to come home each day and to support and connect with the other residents.

On a more logistical note, I need a place to stay in the Palo Alto area for this summer. I will be working as an intern at Environmental Volunteers, a non-profit located in the Baylands of Palo Alto focused on promoting the understanding of and responsibility for the environment through hands-on science education to local children of all backgrounds. I do not own a car and I ideally will be able to bike there everyday in order to reduce my emissions and eliminate transportation costs.",No preference,Nope,"I lived in a two person dorm room for one year and then this last  year in Columbae, a social justice themed co-op at Stanford, with 7-10 roommates.","My ideal community is diverse, supportive, open, and intentional. I thrive in spaces that push me to be open and challenge social norms and preconceptions while also maintaining a supportive community that emphasizes safety and comfort. I hope that I can live in a community composed of people from a variety of backgrounds so that I can continue learning about all kinds different life experiences and social justice issues. I also am drawn to communities in which everyone intentionally contributes to the community’s well-being, for example how in a co-op, all of the residents will work to keep the house clean, cook meals, and uphold the norms of the house. I also want the members of my community to be open and expressive-- artistically and emotionally. I love playing and writing music and sharing it with people, whether that be through jamming or through music recommendations, and I hope that any community I am a part of enjoys engaging in this kind of expression. I also want people to feel comfortable expressing their emotions so that we can create a supportive environment.

",I would likely be able to come most every night.,"I get up and walk over to gently wake the dog. When I try to reach out my hand to stroke the dog, I see a paw where my hand should be. I astutely realize that I am now a dog. I bark in astonishment. 
The other dog wakes and barks back at me: ""Bark! Bark! I am your aunt. Bark!""
""Bark!"" I gasped.
My aunt-dog says to me: ""Bark! The only way back to your human life is to go into the forest. Bark! You must find--bark--a nice leaf and put it inside this brass dingbat. Then--bark--you must place the dingbat on the ancient bookshelf and press on the seventh book from the right on the third row from the top in order to--bark--open the secret entrance to the human world. Bark!""
I sit silently for a moment-- poised in pensive dog-pondering. After a few dog-minutes, I begin to bark: ""Bark! Bark! Bark! Nah man. I'll stay here as a dog. I can pee wherever I want now. Thanks for nothing Aunt Gertrude. Bark!""
I trot off briskly into the forest and I sniff some stuff. fin
","Last quarter in Columbae, I lived in a commune with 10 roommates. I slept in the same room as 8 of them and I had just half of a closet for all of my stuff, but I still had a wonderful time. A few of my roommates also enjoyed playing music and singing, so I set up my drums and my keyboard in the room and we jammed all the time! Sharing good times through music together was a super fun way to become friends, and these friendships helped ease some potential tensions that could have been arisen due to our living situation. I will bring to Ithaka my love of sharing music and making friends.
","I want this summer to be packed with new experiences and new friends. I have loved living in a co-op so far because intentionally sharing space, work, and food with so many other people has created a warm community that has lots of fun together. I hope that Ithaka can foster a similar environment, where people want to spend time with each other. Since Ithaka is close to where I will be working this summer, I hope that I will be able to use the time saved in my short commute to hang out with other residents of the house and have a fun time.

I've heard such amazing things about Ithaka from people who have lived there in the past or over the summer. After visiting for dinner this week, I think it would be such a perfect fit for me. I love the friendships and feelings of family that co-ops foster, and I hope to be able to have a strong community next year in a time of transition out of my undergraduate education to the next stage of my life.

We peruse the bookshelf to see if there's anything interesting to read. I grab a book from the shelf and then we head out the door to explore the surrounding forest. The forest appears to be ancient -- there's thick moss covering the ground and the sides of the towering trees. The dog and I wander around for a while until we come to a trail that leads out into the distance. The dog trots down the trail (seemingly knowing where she's going), so I follow her. The trees start to thin out a bit, and eventually we reach a clearing that looks out over the surrounding mountains. It's a misty, cool morning, so the dog and I curl up together at the base of the tree and I start to read the book from the shelf. It's a mysterious story about a magical garden; the pages are yellowed and smell a bit musty from sitting in the cabin for so many years. The sun comes out, and the dog chases some little critters around the base of the trees. Eventually we head back to the cabin where it still appears as if no one else is around, so the dog and I look around the cabin for a bit and discover a huge garden full of fruits and vegetables. I pick an apricot off of one of the trees, and a new apricot appears again. It seems normal in this place, so I eat the apricot and wander through the rows of plants. The dog is eating raspberries right off the bush, so I join. Although it is a strange place, I feel calm and content because my very mystical aunt had foreseen it. Maybe tomorrow the dog and I will venture a bit further to see if there is a way to get back to life before waking up in the cabin, but for now the majestic trees and garden are the perfect place to be.","I bring enthusiasm, positivity, and compassion to Ithaka. I am extremely invested in my friendships and the people around me, so I would be a caring and loving member of the community. I also think I have valuable skills that I could share with the house. I have a lot of experience cooking for large groups of people from living in a co-op this year, so I would be able to cook lots of yummy vegan and veggie food for the house! I also love to make kombucha, bake bread, and other tasty treats. I love to share my adventures with others, so I would be so excited to organize hikes, camping trips, afternoons at the beach, etc. I also do ceramics, so I would love to make mugs and things for the house or teach people how to make their own vessels at the studio.

Many of my friends who have already been out of undergrad for a while have expressed to me some difficulties they've had transitioning to a new social environment after leaving Stanford, so I am also hoping to go through my coterm with a strong and supportive home environment.

I have enjoyed starting to get to know many wonderful residents as a visitor in the community, during the past week since my return from Guinea, including Clara, Lisa, Ari, and Julia. ","
(1)	I want to live with the people: The time I have spent around Ithaka has shown me that the people who choose/are chosen to live in Ithaka are thoughtful, active, creative humans committed to inclusivity, authentic communication, and communal living that nourishes the world and themselves. I want to share life with these wonderful people and contribute to the community through listening, cooking and cleaning together, creating and connecting. I value relationships above all else and want to live in an intentional community sharing resources and life.
(2)	I want to live sustainably and healthily in community: I have spent 29 months since 2016 living in working in Guinea, West Africa, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and then on independent projects extending from my service. After spending so much time living in rural communal settings, I find the individualistic living habits in the U.S. to be wasteful and absurd. It has been a relief to spend time in Ithaka and with Ithakans, who similarly value living in a sustainable and communal home. 
(3)	I want to cook and eat healthy food: I love cooking healthy meals with beautiful vegetables and sharing them with my community. When I lived on Stanford’s campus in a studio last year, I hosted large potlucks monthly and often invited people over for dinner. Cooking and eating in consistent community at Ithaka would bring me great joy. 
(4)	I want to save money to give to causes that matter to me: Even without financial considerations I would want to live in Ithaka, but finances are certainly an additional motivating factor. I feel very guilty spending money unnecessarily after living in an environment where people make less than a dollar a day. Living in Ithaka would allow me to save money to support student-activists in the community where I served with the Peace Corps, who are working on stopping early marriage and female genital cutting in their villages. I would much rather give those students 10% of my grad-student salary than give it to rent in a community that does not nourish me spiritually or physically. 
",First preference: Share a double with Wren (I would not be comfortable sharing a double with anyone else that I am aware of at the moment)  Second preference: Single ,No ,"- Shared a room with my identical twin sister up to high school in a house with four kids and split cooking/cleaning responsibilities. As a twin, I developed a very collaborative approach to living my everyday life, sharing space, duties and friendship. 
-Shared a cabin with ~12 people for 4-8 weeks at sleep away camp in Northern Ontario for 7 summers.
-Shared a 4-room apartment with 7 people in Harlem, New York for two years following undergrad (graduated 2013) when I was dancing professionally.
-As a Peace Corps volunteer in Guinea, West Africa, I spent 3 months living in a host family (8 people to a 3 room house with shared house tasks including cooking, cleaning, laundry by hand with a washboard, drawing water from a well), and 2 years living in a 2 room hut in a rural village with no running water or electricity, frequented by many guests. During Peace Corps trainings, I shared rooms with up to 10 people, sharing cooking, house maintenance, learning activities, and life.

I stared at him snoring, that large peaceful dog  
And wondered how long it would take for the log to float into the cabin and take me away 
Through the forest to spend one more magical day picking roses to press into books on the shelf 
that would transfer the message to Eaker the elf who would prancer to Justin who knows how to use 
the dingbat that he would then tap to deduce 
the clues to the castle where aunty’s been kept 
since that warm summer night when she fell to her death
her breath never left her it carried her there 
and though we were grieving she left in a prayer: 
“Not to despair, my sweet precious niece.
Go through the forest you’ll find your relief 
In a cabin you’ll see a black dog giving clues
In his snores you’ll discern the exact thing to do” 
","Really solid friendship: I care about my relationships more than anything in my life and always show up for my people when they need me. 

Coaching/emotional awareness/conflict management skills: I love supporting others to be their best selves through listening and coaching. I have developed this skills through friendships and trainings. After my dad's sudden death when I was 17, I urgently sought methods to help me become my most purposeful, engaged, effective, kind, and authentic self. I worked with a life coach whose deep listening skills intrigued me and I wanted to develop skills to share his gift. I participated in workshops and individual coaching and mentorship, including one 5-day workshop, one 3-month course, and two 5-day solo hiking trips in Acadia National Park with no food or electronics. Through these programs, and experiences in the Peace Corps, I have learned (and want to continue learning) conflict management techniques, techniques for recognizing my own ego and not letting it drive me, ways of listening and communicating that allow me and others to inquire deeply and tap into new clarity. These are all parts of my background that I love sharing with the communities with which I am involved. 

Love of movement/dancing/sharing body knowledge: I have been engaged in diverse physical activities since second grade, culminating in a couple of years as a professional dancer. As a result, I have over 30,000 hours of training in Pilates, dance, yoga, physical therapy and other body knowledge. I would love to share this knowledge with members of the community through morning pilates, yoga, or dance, and also in side conversations on how to improve body use to avoid injury. I am also now an active runner and hiker and would like to get to know the community through running and hiking together. 

Music/songwriting: I love playing and writing music (on guitar) and have a history of writing fun music about communities I am involved in (a trait that Wren and I share). 

Love of healthy cooking: Developed in the way I was raised and during my time as a dancer. 

Awareness of the outside world: I have had many experiences outside of university bubbles (freelance performing arts in New York, Peace Corps in Guinea etc.).  
","-Motivation to be my best self and live sustainably in an environment (Palo Alto) where it is very easy to be influenced to live wastefully
-A Palo Alto family with whom to grow, create, hike, run and expand my mind. 
-A consistent community of thoughtful inclusive people outside the Stanford bubble 
-New vegetable recipes   
-A community where I can cherish other’s authentic selves and be valued and seen for my authentic self. 
-I grew up going to a performing arts school in Toronto, Canada, where we spent half the day on academic curriculum and the other half immersed in the arts (dance, drama, music and visual arts). Since then, I’ve participated in 10 full time two-six week dance/theatre/creative writing intensives. All of these camps/schools encouraged imagination and creativity in the same way I have experienced so far in Ithaka. I really miss being surrounded by such creativity, and one of my goals for this year is to find ways of integrating communal creativity back into my life. I have found that in dance parties/jam sessions at Ithaka even in the few days I’ve spent there. Ithaka feels like home to me after spending so much time in creative communal settings.

I've spent time abroad living in commune-type living situations for over a year. This past year I lived with a host family in Palo Alto.","My ideal community feel dynamic. It takes the shape of those who live there. It morphs, grows, changes, listens to the needs of individuals, supports the pursuits and dreams of others, and allows for self-expression. 

One of my ideal living communities I stumbled upon in Uganda. For a year, I lived and did life with people who grew up the streets, public health people, social advocates, rappers, dancers, and kickboxing champions. Every night we would gather around the back porch and cook dinner together. We sipped chai tea under the stars, told stories, and found stillness in the constant movement. I remember free-style rapping in multiple languages while the rice boiled. I remember crying together. I remember treating each other like brothers and sisters. I remember listening and challenging each other's world views in a way that was grounded on a shared respect and love for the other person. This felt like a sense of wholeness that opened up what I began to see could be possible when people live in community together.",I expect to be able to attend house dinners 4-5 times per week and will ensure that I can be at house meetings each week.,"I realized I've woken up in a lucid dream. The only next step is to explore, of course. I walk over to the black dog, oversized Burmese mountain to rub behind his ears. He wakes up with me, eyes locking in golden peace and we walk together through the open door. The door frame, wooden and rough, melts into a gentle pool of water behind me and I am left in an open clearing of lake juxtaposed against pine forest. I have no idea how to get back but it also doesn't matter. Realizing that (finally!) I can fly, I try to flap my arms but I feel heavy and can't get off the ground. Above me in the tree is a woodpecker, tapping out a soft swing beat that I can't seem to get out of my head. I wonder if I can let the rhythm flow through me and if that will let me become lighter. I surrender to the dum dum da-dum and a bubbling up happens in my chest and my limbs. I'm flying. I let myself surrender to peace, free floating in the air. The pine trees, black Burmese dog, and the lone woodpecker watch as I ascend into the sky, disappearing into a speck of nothingness.","-love for those who live there
